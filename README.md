# grade-predictor
uses polynomial regression and gradient descent to predict the direction of future grades

to run this, you need ImGui, ImPlot, DirectX 11, and whatever else is included in the main file. its kinda BS to run because of all of these files and i could have done it another way, but this project was to improve my c++ skills
